I am post-doctoral researcher in the <a href="https://casrl.ece.ucf.edu/" target="_blank">Computer Architecture and Systems Research (CASR) Lab</a> at UCF. I have received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Engineering from <a href="https://www.ucf.edu/" target="_blank">University of Central Florida</a> where I was advised by <a href="http://fan-yao.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Fan Yao</a>.
<br>
My research interest is at the area of computer architecture and security, focusing on the development of secure and high-performance microarchitectural systems and emerging memory architectures. My work has led to the identification of new vulnerabilities in modern CPU microarchitecture and secure processors. I have also designed secure and high-performance architecture for memory and storage subsystems. I have published as first author in many prestigious venues, including all three top-tier architecture conferences (<strong>ISCA</strong>,  <strong>MICRO</strong>, and <strong>HPCA</strong>) and the Systems Security Conference (<strong>S&P</strong>).
