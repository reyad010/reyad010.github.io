I am post-doctoral researcher in the
<a href="https://casrl.ece.ucf.edu/" target="_blank"
  >Computer Architecture and Systems Research (CASR) Lab</a
>
at UCF. I have received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Engineering from
<a href="https://www.ucf.edu/" target="_blank">University of Central Florida</a>
where I was advised by
<a href="http://fan-yao.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Fan Yao</a>.
<br />
My research interest is at the area of computer architecture and security,
focusing on the development of secure and high-performance microarchitectural
systems and emerging memory architectures. My work has led to the identification
of new vulnerabilities in modern CPU microarchitecture and secure processors. I
have also designed secure and high-performance architecture for memory and
storage subsystems. I have published as first author in many prestigious venues,
including all three top-tier architecture conferences (<strong>ISCA</strong>,
<strong>MICRO</strong>, and <strong>HPCA</strong>) and the Systems Security
Conference (<strong>S&P</strong>).
