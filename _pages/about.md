I am post-doctoral researcher in the [Computer Architecture and Systems Research (CASR) Lab](https://casrl.ece.ucf.edu/) at UCF. I have received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Engineering from [University of Central Florida](https://www.ucf.edu/) where I was advised by [Dr. Fan Yao](http://fan-yao.com/).

My research interest is at the area of computer architecture and security, focusing on the development of secure and high-performance microarchitectural systems and emerging memory architectures. My work has led to the identification of new vulnerabilities in modern CPU microarchitecture and secure processors. I have also designed secure and high-performance architecture for memory and storage subsystems. I have published as first author in many prestigious venues, including all three top-tier architecture conferences (ISCA, MICRO, and HPCA) and the Systems Security Conference (S&P).
