excerpt: 'Phase Change Memory (PCM) is a promising contender for future main memory solutions. While many architecture-level performance optimizations have been studied for PCM, the security implications of these designs are not well understood. This work demonstrates the first investigation of information leakage threats in PCM-based main memories. Notably, we find state-of-the-art read techniques leveraging access latency asymmetry in Multi-level Cell (MLC) PCM introduce new timing variations. To understand the severity of the vulnerability, we present R-SAW, a novel side channel attack that aims to exfiltrate secrets from a victim process via passively observing execution timings that are correlated with secret-dependent PCM accesses. We demonstrate the attack on a real-world cryptographic algorithm–AES encryption in OpenSSL. Our evaluation shows that R-SAW is able to completely recover the encryption keys. Furthermore, our experiments reveal that R-SAW exhibits superior noise resilience compared to the widely-studied cachebased side channels. Our work highlights the importance of understanding security in systems integrated with emerging memory technologies and motivates the need to architect secure-by-design PCM main memories in the future.'
