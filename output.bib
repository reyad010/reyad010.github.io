@inproceedings{ivleague,author={Chowdhuryy, Md Hafizul Islam and Yao, Fan},title={IvLeague: Side Channel-resistant Secure Architectures Using Isolated Domains of Dynamic Integrity Trees},year={2024},abstract={Modern secure processors rely on hardware-assisted encryption and tree-based integrity verification to protect off-chip data. However, despite extensive research on performance optimization, there is a significant lack of emphasis on side channel vulnerabilities in secure architectures. Given the strong focus on data security, it is critical to ensure that the integration of new design elements into secure architectures does not inadvertently introduce additional vulnerabilities. Existing integrity verification mechanisms use a global integrity tree shared across security domains, which can introduce side channel leakage through integrity tree metadata sharing. In this work, we present IvLeague framework – a novel integrity verification mechanism for side channel-resistant isolated integrity trees among dynamic domains in secure processors. Specifically, IvLeague splits the global tree into multiple fixed-size subtrees, dynamically allocating these subtrees to domains during runtime. IvLeague enables efficient runtime scaling of memory coverage for individual domains. Additionally, we IvLeague-Invert, an optimization which shortens the integrity verification path by mapping data pages to high-level tree nodes. Finally, IvLeaguePro further improves the integrity verification of hotpages by enabling efficient hotpage tracking and migrating hotpages closer to the root. We extensively evaluate all three IvLeague schemes using 16 real-world workloads with varying memory footprints. IvLeague scheme, along with its optimizations, demonstrates a 5%-19% speedup over the insecure baseline, while providing effective side channel protection for the integrity tree. Moreover, IvLeague ensures high utilization of TreeLings (over 99.5%) and supports workloads with highly skewed memory footprints.},booktitle={IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO)},pages={117–130},numpages={14},keywords={Secure architectures, Metadata Side channels, Trusted execution environment, Isolated integrity trees},location={Austin, Texas, USA},series={MICRO '24}}

Mainstream ML backdoor attacks typically involve either poisoning the victim’s training samples or pre-training poisoned models for use by victim users. Meanwhile, recent advances in hardware-based threats reveal that ML model integrity at inference-time can be seriously tampered by inducing transient faults in model weights. However, the adversarial impacts of such hardware fault attacks at training time have not been well understood. In this paper, we present DeepVenom, the first end-to-end hardware-based DNN backdoor attack during victim model training. Particularly, DeepVenom can insert a targeted backdoor persistently at the victim model fine-tuning runtime through transient faults in model weight memory (via rowhammer). DeepVenom manifests in two main steps: i) an offline step that identifies weight perturbation transferable to the victim model using an ensemble-based local model bit search algorithm, and ii) an online stage that integrates advanced system-level techniques to efficiently massage weight tensors for precise rowhammer-based bit flips. DeepVenom further employs a novel iterative backdoor boosting mechanism that performs multiple rounds of weight perturbations to stabilize the backdoor. We implement an end-to-end DeepVenom attack in real systems with DDR3/DDR4 memories, and evaluate it using state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network and Vision Transformer models. The results show that DeepVenom can effectively generate backdoors in victim’s fine-tuned models with upto 99.8% attack success rate (97.8% on average) using as few as 11 total weight bit flips (maximum 49). The evaluation further demonstrates that DeepVenom is successful under varying victim fine-tuning hyperparameter settings, and is highly robust against catastrophic forgetting. Our work highlights the practicality of training-time backdoors through hardware-based weight perturbation, which represents a new dimension in adversarial machine learning.},keywords={hardware fault attacks;training-time backdoors;fine-tuning;rowhammer;weight perturbation},doi={10.1109/SP54263.2024.00223},url={https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/SP54263.2024.00223},publisher={IEEE Computer Society},address={Los Alamitos, CA, USA},month={may}}
